## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    One challenge that I had while building the app would have to be creating the "read more" drop down feature. I wasnt too sure where to start for building that but i did some research and took my time with it and i think it came out well. The cards werent too much of a challenge as i had created them before.
